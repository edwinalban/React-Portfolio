# React-Portfolio
A portfolio of my work made with React Components

Creates a portfolio for housing projects and showcasing deployed apps.

## Description

I built this project in order to practice using React components to build a front end for a portfolio. I learned about React components, mapping properties of objects, and how to build a front end application that does not require reloading.
